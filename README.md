# Image-classification-using-Fasion-MNIST-dataset

# Description
My application is a machine learning model that classify images from the fashion MNIST dataset which contain 70 thousand images of size (28, 28) provided by keresdataset library.
the model has a 97.97% training accuracy and a 92.07% evaluation accuracy.

I used tnesorflow version 2.3.0 to build the model in jupyter notebook.
